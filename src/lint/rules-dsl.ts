/**
 * Parses a `LintRuleDocument` (see `./schema.ts` and `docs/lint/rules.md`)
 * written directly in DON syntax (a `.donly` rules file) instead of JSON —
 * e.g.
 *
 * ```don
 * or {
 *   /server/port { required }
 *   /server/socket { required }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * is the DON-syntax equivalent of:
 *
 * ```json
 * {
 *   "or": [
 *     { "/server/port": { "required": true } },
 *     { "/server/socket": { "required": true } }
 *   ]
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The conversion is structural, not schema-aware: every directive becomes
 * an object entry keyed by its own name (a path selector like `/server`,
 * an argument selector like `[1]`, or a plain property name like
 * `required`/`type`/`message`), with its value built the same way,
 * recursively — mirroring how `DirectiveJSONEncoder`'s reducers turn a
 * directive tree into plain JSON, just specialized to this schema's shape:
 *
 * - A directive with neither args nor children is a bare boolean flag
 *   (`required` -> `true`).
 * - A directive with args but no children is a scalar (`max 1` -> `1`,
 *   `type "number"` -> `"number"`) or, with more than one arg, an array
 *   (`enum "a" "b" "c"` -> `["a", "b", "c"]`).
 * - A directive with children becomes an object built from them. A leading
 *   *string* argument alongside children is shorthand for `message` (see
 *   the `/respond "..." { min 1 }` example in `docs/lint/rules.md`).
 * - `or`/`and` become arrays, `not` a single entry — see `orAndEntry` below
 *   for how each of their own children becomes one array entry.
 *
 * Because `/*` collides with DON's own block-comment syntax, the wildcard
 * sub-path selector must be written quoted: `"/*"`. The bare root selector
 * `/` is unaffected and needs no quoting.
